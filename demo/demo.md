## Features

### Authentication

#### demo

[DEMO](/private/axolotl.jpg)

Login with user1:password1. Cookie lasts for 10 seconds. Go to /private/seal.gif for alternate image

#### description

Ability to set authentication on certain directories.
Cookies are enabled to keep authentication status and are valid until our specified timeout.

#### config

Same as StaticHandler, but add the following in the config block section

`authentication_list <authentication_txt_file>`
`timeout <cookie_expiration_in_sec>`

#### example

	path /private StaticHandler {
		root private;
		authentication_list authentication.txt;
		timeout 10;
	}

#### details

- username and password login page if accessing restricted directory
- if authenticated, cookie given to browser to keep authentication for certain timeout
	- server also stores authenticated cookies and periodically clears them
- currently storing usernames and passwords as plaintext, but could be implemented fully with database later
